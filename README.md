# Delicious Library 3™ — Unofficial Unsupported Cloud Sync

This is a simple shell script so that the data files used by Delicious Library 3™ 
software for Mac made by Delicious Monster Software can be shared across 
multiple computers in your possession.

## Rant

This software cost $38 and for this much money, seriously? I can't even auto-sync
my data between devices? Wat?

I can't link the books I own on Kindle or iBooks with Delicious Library? Wat?

I have more to say but time is short.

## Using it

The idea is you must use DropBox, iCloud, Google Drive or something like that to move the files that the software uses to store it's data. This is what this script does.

Unfortunately, the authors did not address merging information, so if you change the same files on two computers at the same time, results are not predictable. So be careful and enjoy!
